# Nonparametric Doubly Robust Inference on Dose-Response Curve and its Derivative
This repository contains Python3 code for implementing the regression adjustment (RA), inverse probability weighting (IPW), and doubly robust (DR) estimators of dose-response curve and its derivative with and without the positivity condition.
